  history: `On August 8th, 2018 Crawfish became the 10th team in the Major league after a multi-round server vote on possible teams. It was founded by Hughmungus and ‚ÄúKoric 1v2‚Äù, who quickly expanded the team with a vast array of talent. After winning 2 consecutive seasons 17-1 and losing only a single playoff game between the seasons, many of Crawfish's founding members retired or took a step back from the game.

‚ÄútheShow‚Äù became the second leader through an election, cementing Craw's democratic precedent. Crawfish continued to be stripped of its veterans through season 5 and 6 - during which Jprawnz and then Vorce lead the team - but going into s7 their new talent matured to become veterans in their own right, and some older players returned or became more active. With a powerful season 7 performance that gained them second seed going into the playoffs, and their junior Shrimps becoming the dominant minor team, Crawfish is poised to be a perennial top team.`,
